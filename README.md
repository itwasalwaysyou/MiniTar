# MiniTar
The goal of this project is to develop a simplified version of the tar utility, called minitar.

    • It will allow user to create to create archives from files, modify existing archives, 
      and extract the original files back from an archive.
    • minitar is fully Posix-compliant, meaning it can freely interoperate with all of the 
      standard tape-archive utility programs like the original tar.
