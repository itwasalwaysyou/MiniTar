# MiniTar
The goal of this project is to develop a simplified version of the tar utility, called minitar.

    • It will allow user to create to create archives from files, modify existing archives, 
      and extract the original files back from an archive.
    • minitar is fully Posix-compliant, meaning it can freely interoperate with all of the 
      standard tape-archive utility programs like the original tar. 
      
## Implementing the Archive Operations
Archive Create

    Example Command: ./minitar -c -f foo.tar hello.txt hola.txt

You will need to iterate through all specified files, generate a header for each file (check out the fill_tar_header function), and write each file’s header and contents as a sequence of 512-byte blocks. For example, the tape archive generated by the command above would have the following structure:

Hint: Remember that files are always represented in a tape archive using an integral number of 512-byte blocks. Each file’s last block will probably have some unused space.

## Archive Append

    Example Command: ./minitar -a -f foo.tar goodbye.txt adios.txt

Make sure that the specified archive file (foo.tar in the example above) actually exists first. Then, add new representations of the specified member files (goodbye.txt and adios.txt above) to the archive file.

Hint: Be mindful of the tar footer here. The archive will have an existing footer (two blocks of zero bytes) that you will need to remove before writing blocks for the newly appended files. You may use the remove_trailing_bytes function we have provided for this purpose. Then, you’ll need to add a footer to the newly extended archive file.

The archive file created after the append command given above would have the following structure:

## List Archive Member Files

    Example Command: ./minitar -t -f foo.tar

Iterate through the archive file’s header blocks, printing out the name field from each one.

Hint: Think carefully about how you’ll know when you’ve reached the end of the archive and can stop reading more data from the file.

Using the running example archive from above, the output of the list operation would be:

hello.txt
hola.txt
goodbye.txt
adios.txt

## Update Archive Member Files

    Example Command: ./minitar -u -f foo.tar goodbye.txt adios.txt

A user may want to include a newer version of one or more member file already present in an archive. This is effectively the same as an append -- the contents added to the archive are just new contents for a previously added file rather than a brand new file. This means a single archive can have two (or more) sequences of blocks for a file with the same name.

This can lead to strange things like the same file name getting printed out twice in a list operation. However, this situation can also nicely simplify your implementation, as update operations are very similar to append operations.

First, verify that all of the files are present in the specified archive file.

If the user attempts to update a file that does not have a previous version already stored in the specified archive file (e.g., foo.tar does not contain a version of adios.txt in the example command above), then your program should print out the following message: Error: One or more of the specified files is not already present in archive. Note that you will need to match this error message exactly to pass some of our tests.

    Hint: This is essentially just an append operation with the additional step of verifying that each file already has a version present in the archive. Try to reuse your code from the append operation as much as possible.

Using our running example, the archive would have the following structure after the update command given above.

## Extract Member Files From Archive

    Example Command: ./minitar -x -f foo.tar

Iterate through the archive and create a new file in the current working directory for each member file contained in the archive. If there are multiple versions of the same file present in the archive, only the version of the file most recently added to the archive should be extracted.

    Hint: Be careful about sizes here. The contents of all member files in the archive are represented as 512-byte blocks, but you won’t want to write out the full contents of the file’s last block if that file’s size is not a clean multiple of 512.

We have not provided automated tests for archive extraction, although we will still be testing your submission for this functionality. You will need to test extraction yourself. In particular, make sure your implementation is able to correctly extract files from an archive generated by minitar or an archive generated by the standard tar program.
